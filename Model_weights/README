About the model x4 and x2, when you load the model, remember to add an argument: model = UNet(bilinear=0).to(device) in order to change the layer upsample to conv2dTrans.
About the model input and output, before feeding an image into the model, you need to normalize it by: image = image/324.260009765625. The model output needs to multiply with the same number 324.260009765625: output = output*324.260009765625.
About SR Resnet, you can load it by: model = ResNet(12, 256).to(device)
About model x4 U-Net with Residual blocks, when loading: model = UNet(n_resblocks=1,bilinear=0).to(device) with n_resblocks is the desired number of residual blocks in the architecture.
